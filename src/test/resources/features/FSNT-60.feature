Feature: RTE within Text component | Authoring

  â€¢As an author, I can see that:
  1) This component is identical to the OOTB
  2) This component is to be used everywhere on the site
  3) This component is authorable for internal/external pages
  4) This component is to be configurable
  5) The characters entered via the US keyboard, such as <, >, ~, |, parentheses, can be used in the RTE without any issues since they can be interpreted in HTML code.
  6) Author should be able to assign typography style classes from the Style Guide to H1, H2, P tags
